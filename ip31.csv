The latest being that 1) after watching for about an hour it crashes, and cannot be brought up again for at least another hour - which means that the programmes which for 'legal reasons cannot be replayed on iplayer' can NEVER be watched. 1) frequently content won't load AT ALL...

Looking at other reviews it seems I'm not alone. 
In fact seeing the sheer number of negative comments it appears that very little gets done about any reported problems. 
Considering the fantastic overall quality of BBC programmes, you do your programme makers serious disservice by allowing so many reported faults to go unchecked. It makes me very sad to know that your star ratings just go on being pathetic over the four years I've been able to use this app, in particular where your competitors consistently do so much better.
