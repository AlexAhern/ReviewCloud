"BBC iPlayer",2017-05-02,,"So disappointed that after numerous updates the BBC have still not fixed the crucial feature they broke many updates ago. Downloads used to work on the HTC one m9 but about a year ago the BBC broke this in an update. All they need to do is to look at the code they changed. Also doesn't work on Kindle fire and so many other devices. Instead of fixing this functionality everyone wants the developers choose to put their resources into programming pointless startup effects.  The glacial speed with which the developers are rolling out fixes to one phone model or another is slower than new phones are being produced for which the app doesn't work. In the internet age we should get a reduction in our licence fees for lack of internet functionality.","Steve Locks",1,,

"BBC iPlayer",2017-05-02,,"After trying unsuccessfully to download a programme on android phone, I was advised via BBC live chat to mess about by deleting the app, turning off WiFi, turning off phone. Turning phone back on, turning WiFi back on, reinstalling iPlayer, installing BBC media player. Downloaded 100%, then a message to say download failed.  Come on BBC, sort it out. We pay enough for the licence fee. Just wasted an hour of my life trying to sort this out ffs.","Kay Rogers",1,,

I'm lucky to be fully sighted and not hard of hearing and pay full licence fee but the option to remove audio description is not there. It's intensely irritating and is twice as loud as the soundtrack. Worst update so far! Plus there's no HD any more and no option in the settings for that either! I commend the accessibility options, but it would be great to have the option not to use for those that don't require it!","Eddie Case",1,,
